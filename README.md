Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the Boston Housing dataset from a CSV file and preprocess the data by converting the prices from USD to Indian Rupees.
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of the features and the target variable (housing prices).
Model Development: Develop a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on the preprocessed data.
Model Training and Testing: Train the model on a portion of the data and test its performance on the remaining data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Model Improvement: Identify ways to improve the model's performance, such as feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language used for developing the linear regression model.
Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: A Python library used for machine learning tasks, including linear regression.
Matplotlib: A Python library used for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: A web-based interactive environment used for developing and testing the model.
Deliverables:

Linear Regression Model: A trained linear regression model that can predict housing prices based on various features.
Model Evaluation Metrics: The performance metrics of the model, including MSE and MAE.
Data Visualization: A plot showing the predicted values against the actual values.
Model Improvement Suggestions: A list of suggestions for improving the model's performance.
